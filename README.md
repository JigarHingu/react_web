## 🚀 Features

This project is a comprehensive demonstration of the following features and concepts:

- Dynamic routes for individual blog posts (`/posts/:id`)
- A custom **404 Not Found** page with a playable game

### ⚛️ State Management
- Uses `useState` and `useEffect` for managing component state, fetching data, and handling side effects.

### 🎯 Interactive UI
- **Real-time Search**: A debounced search bar on the homepage to filter posts by title or content.
- **Sorting**: Controls to sort blog posts alphabetically.
- **Animated Search Panel**: A clean, slide-down panel for search and sort controls.

### ✍️ Form Handling
- Fully functional newsletter signup page
- Demonstrates form state management and user submission handling

### 🧪 Custom Hooks
- Includes a custom `useDebounce` hook to optimize search and prevent excessive re-renders.

### 📚 Interactive Documentation

- **Interview Q&A Page**: Searchable accordion explaining each concept used in the project.
